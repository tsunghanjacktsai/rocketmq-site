# Introduction
This project is the new official documentation site for rocketmq.
This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

For all of you who contribute documents, here are a few things to keep in mind：

1. For the person responsible for writing the documentation, the only thing you need to modify is the content under ‘/docs’. Find the document you are responsible for under ‘/docs’ and write it in markdown. The rest of the site is automatic, so please do not modify it.

2. For those who do translations, we are currently placing English documents at ‘/docs/09-English’ for the time being due to the error-prone nature of the multilingual version of the site.

3. The framework we currently use supports some nice markdown features, please refer to it and try to speak about the beautiful writing of the document.[Markdown Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features)


For those of you who have contributed documentation and wish to see the results after writing, please refer to the following command.
