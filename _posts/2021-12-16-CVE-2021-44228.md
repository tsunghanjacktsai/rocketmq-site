### Apache RocketMQ is not affected by this CVE-2021-44228.

- Apache RocketMQ does not depend on log4j2 actually, although there are imports in the pom file.
- Apache RocketMQ's broker depends on the logbackï¼Œand RocketMQ's client depends on log4j2, but its dependency scope is test, and the related dependencies have been deleted in this PR [#3635](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/3635) .
- Apache RocketMQ's logappender depends on log4j2, but it is optional, Therefore, the release file does not contain log4j2 related dependencies.
- Apache RocketMQ still bumped up the log4j2 version in PRs [#3621](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/3621) [#3623](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/3623), and developers can cherry-pick related PRs to your private repo to deal with code scanning, and we expect RocketMQ 4.9.3 to be released in the next 1-2 weeks.
