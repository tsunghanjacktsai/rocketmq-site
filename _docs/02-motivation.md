At early stages, we constructed our distributed messaging middleware based on ActiveMQ 5.x(prior to 5.3). Our 
multinational business uses it for asynchronous communication, search, social network activity stream, data pipeline,
even in its trade processes. As our trade business throughput rises, pressure originating from our messaging cluster
also becomes urgent.

# Why RocketMQ ?

Based on our research, with increased queues and virtual topics in use, ActiveMQ IO module reaches a bottleneck. We 
tried our best to solve this problem through throttling, circuit breaker or degradation, but it did not work well. So 
we begin to focus on the popular messaging solution Kafka at that time. Unfortunately, Kafka can not meet our 
requirements especially in terms of low latency and high reliability, see [here](/rocketmq/how-to-support-more-queues-in-rocketmq/) for details.

In this context, we decided to invent a new messaging engine to handle a broader set of use cases, ranging from 
traditional pub/sub scenarios to high volume real-time zero-loss tolerance transaction system. We believe this solution
can be beneficial, so we would like to open source it to the community. Today, more than 100 companies are using the 
open source version of RocketMQ in their business. 

The following table demonstrates the comparison between RocketMQ, ActiveMQ and Kafka (Apache's most popular messaging solutions according to [awesome-java](https://github.com/akullpp/awesome-java)):

# RocketMQ vs. ActiveMQ vs. Kafka

Please note this documentation is written by the RocketMQ team. Although the ideal is a disinterested comparison of technology and features, the authors’ expertise and biases obviously favor RocketMQ.

The table below is a handy quick reference for spotting the differences among RocketMQ and its most popular alternatives at a glance.
